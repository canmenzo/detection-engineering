# ADR 0003 — Evaluate rules over labelled JSON events with the pySigma SQLite backend

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-14

## Context

Detection quality was unmeasured. Tests asserted only "fires on an attack sample"
and "silent on a benign one", 14 of 15 rules had no benign counter-example, and
the single negative case used a different event channel — so it proved nothing
about the rule's discrimination.

Measuring precision, recall and FP rate needs many labelled events per rule,
including benign look-alikes that differ from the true positive only where the
rule's logic should bite. Hayabusa cannot supply that: it consumes EVTX only
(`-J` JSON input does not apply Sigma `process_creation`/`ps_script` matching —
see ADR 0002), and no public EVTX corpus contains curated benign look-alikes for
these behaviours. Authoring EVTX by hand is not practical.

Three options were considered for a second evaluator that consumes JSON:

1. **Zircolite** — runs Sigma against JSONL. Not on PyPI; it is distributed as a
   GitHub repository plus release binaries, so it cannot be locked in `uv.lock`
   and would reintroduce the "download a binary from a release page" problem that
   already makes the Hayabusa step the most fragile part of CI.
2. **A hand-written matcher** over pySigma's parsed rule objects. Full control,
   but ~300 lines of security-critical matching logic that we would own, test and
   keep in step with pySigma's modifier semantics.
3. **`pysigma-backend-sqlite`** — a maintained pySigma backend that renders a
   rule to SQL. Load labelled events into an in-memory SQLite table, run the SQL,
   count matching rows. This is what Zircolite does internally, without the tool.

## Decision

Option 3. Rules are converted with the SQLite backend and evaluated against
labelled JSON events loaded into an in-memory table.

Hayabusa is kept as an independent second engine over real EVTX. The two engines
must agree; disagreement fails the build. Two independent implementations of
Sigma semantics checking each other is worth more than either alone.

### Validation

The approach was proven before anything was built. All 15 authored rules convert
to SQL. Every existing fixture sample was dumped to JSON with `evtx_dump`,
flattened, loaded into SQLite, and evaluated — then compared against Hayabusa on
the same file:

**15 of 15 cases agree, on the exact hit count, not merely the verdict.**

### Consequences and the semantics this pinned down

Three behaviours had to be defined explicitly, and each is a real decision:

- **A field absent from the data must not match, not raise.** Every field a rule
  references is materialised as a NULL column. Note that SQL three-valued logic
  means a negated condition over an absent field is also false, which differs
  from Sigma, where an unsatisfiable filter under `not` is true. No current rule
  depends on that case; when one does, it needs an explicit test.
- **Numeric strings are coerced on load.** EVTX `EventData` values are strings in
  the XML, so `PreAuthType` arrives as `"0"` while the rule (and SigmaHQ's own
  `win_security_kerberos_asrep_roasting.yml`) says `PreAuthType: 0`. Hayabusa
  compares loosely and matches; SQLite does not. Without coercion the AS-REP rule
  silently stops matching — 14/15 agreement instead of 15/15.

  This makes the evaluator as lenient as Hayabusa, and **more lenient than a
  strictly-typed backend**. A KQL query comparing an integer literal against a
  string column would miss this detection in production. Precision measured here
  is precision under loose typing; it is not a claim about a strict SIEM.
- **UInt64 keyword masks overflow SQLite's INTEGER** and are stored as text.

## Alternatives not taken

Writing our own matcher (option 2) remains viable if the SQLite backend is
abandoned upstream. The cost of switching is bounded: the harness depends on
"rule in, matching row IDs out", not on SQL.
